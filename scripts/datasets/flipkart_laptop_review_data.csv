187,Excellent,5,Display performance is awesome with 144 mhz refresh rated. Its the best gaming laptop for this price range. No other laptop can match the specs while maintaining a good price like this one does. Its worth of money. It has a top tier GPU with ray tracing tech and 16 GB of RAM along with a RTX 3050 Ti 4Gb graphic cards give you best gaming experience. Laptop cooling system is working perfectly. This combination has yet to be matched at this price range and hence provides the best performance.,18,6
